Clinexa
Clinexa is a Clinical Management System designed to streamline interactions between doctors and patients. It features a complete appointment booking engine, role-based dashboards, and a custom CSV-based persistence layer, developed for the CSAI203 Software Engineering course.

Project Architecture
The application implements a strict MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with a Repository Pattern to decouple business logic from data access.

src/controllers/: Orchestrates logic between the UI and data models.
src/repositories/: Handles direct interactions with the CSV database.
src/models/: Python classes representing core entities (Doctor, Patient, Appointment).
src/data/: Flat-file database storage containing all system records in CSV format.
src/core/: Core system utilities including Authentication and CSV management.
Key Features
Role-Based Access:
Doctors: Manage schedules, view appointments, and upload reports.
Patients: Book appointments, view medical reports, and rate/review doctors.
Appointment System: Full lifecycle management (Booking, Scheduling, History).
Feedback Loop: Integrated rating system stored in feedback.csv.
Data Persistence: Custom-built CSV manager ensuring data integrity.
Secure Authentication: Hashed credentials and session management.

Installation & Setup
We recommend running Clinexa by pulling the pre-built image from Docker Hub.

Prerequisites
Docker Desktop or Docker Engine installed.
Git.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/r4g4b/clinexa.git](https://github.com/r4g4b/clinexa.git)
cd clinexa
Step 2: Pull the Docker Image
Instead of building manually, pull the latest verified version directly from the cloud.

docker pull j4b4l/clinexa:latest
Step 3: Run the Application
Start the container and map port 5000.

docker run -p 5000:5000 j4b4l/clinexa:latest
(Optional: To keep data saved locally, map the data folder):

docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/src/data:/app/src/data j4b4l/clinexa:latest
Alternative: Build Locally
If you prefer to build the image from source on your machine:

docker build -t clinexa-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 clinexa-app
Step 4: Access the App
Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000

Testing
The project maintains a high standard of code quality with a full test suite.

Run all tests (Local Python):

pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_tests_dispatch.py all
Run tests inside Docker:

docker build -t clinexa-test .
docker run clinexa-test python run_tests_dispatch.py all
